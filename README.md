# Zacharias

Zaharias is a voice assistant currently on developpment.

It goal is to reproduce a kind of Jarvis from IronMan, but in a possible way.
It has to be the more generic as possible to be able to adapt with all the situations possible. For this purpose, NLP modules and Deeplearning models are used to better analyse the human speech.

### The major functionnalities here are :
- voice detection on local (using vosk)
- intent classification using spacy (currently under dev)
- answer in TextToSpeech (to be done)
